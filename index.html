      <p>Hi, I am Jamie Lee, a rising highschool junior who is a novice in the world of computer science and coding.</p>
      <p> In my spare time, I enjoy drawing both traditionally and digitally, sculpting, listening to music by artists such as Eve and Keshi, and watching anime.</p>
        <p> I hope to become a computer software engineer in the future and be involved with coding video games and different websites.</p>
