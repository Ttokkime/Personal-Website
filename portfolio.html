    <p class="pg"> This is a code I made in the past during my freshman year of highschool using javascript language. </p>
      <p class="pg">I made a code that simulated the Hailstone Series concept. 
    </p>
    <p class="pg">The code first starts off with an integer value that is greater than 0, which in this case will be x.</p>
    <p class="pg"> x is even, then the next value in the series is x/2. If x is odd, then the next value in the series is 3x + 1. </p>
      <p class="pg">The series will inevitably end with the value 1 at the very end. </p>
